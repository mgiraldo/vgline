This is the base Flash AS3 code for "the videogame timeline" available at http://www.mauriciogiraldo.com/vgline/beta/. These files require an additional interface file (a FLA file) with the required MovieClips in use. Changes can be made so such a file is not needed (building the interface programmatically).

This AS3 project is dependent upon these other libraries:
